# Interpretable Deep Learning-based Solar Flare Prediction with post hoc Attention for Operational Forecasting
This repo presents a post hoc analysis of a deep learning-based full-disk solar flare prediction model using three post hoc attention methods: (i) Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, (ii) Deep Shapley Additive Explanations, and (iii) Integrated Gradients.
